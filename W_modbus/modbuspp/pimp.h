/*
 * Internal: Pointer to implementation
 * "Pointer to implementation" or "pImpl" is a C++ programming technique that
 * removes implementation details of a class from its object representation by
 * placing them in a separate class, accessed through an opaque pointer.
 * This technique is used to construct C++ library interfaces with stable
 * ABI and to reduce compile-time dependencies.
